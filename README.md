* Receiving an offer is not about solving questions flawlessly. Rather, it is about answering questions better than other candidates.  

* Your interviewer will make an assessment of your performance, usually based on the following:
    * Analytical skills
    * Coding skills
    * Technical knowledge/Computer Science fundermentals
    * Experience
    * Culture fit/Communication skills  

* Basic data structure and algorithm knowledge is useful.

This is a service which can give a score to a software engineer's skills and realize an appropriate recruitment. An engineer can prove his own skills by taking more than 4000 free published tests which is called "Code challenge".
